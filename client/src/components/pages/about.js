      <p>
        I'm Heber Marcano, a passionate junior software developer with a knack
        for creating intuitive and efficient applications. Graduating from
        University of Minnesota Bootcamp, I've honed my skills in HTML, Git,
        CSS, JavaScript, Web-Apis, Third-Party-Apis,
        Server-Side-APIs,Node.js,Express,SQL,ORM,MVC,NoSQL,MERNd. My journey in
        coding started from me buying a gaming pc and loving it so much that I
        wanted to learn how to build a simple application, to then getting into
        a Bootcamp, which ignited my love for technology. I thrive in
        collaborative environments and am always eager to learn the latest
        industry trends. Outside of coding, I enjoy cooking, my pets, gaming,
        and learning new things. My goal is to craft software that makes a tangible difference in
        people's lives. I'm excited about the endless possibilities this field
        offers and am eager to contribute my skills to meaningful projects.
        Let's build something amazing together!
